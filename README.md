# NordVpn Connection Checker

## Introduction

This is simple windows tray app which is checking (by request to NordVPN  https://nordvpn.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=get_user_info_data) if internet traffic is
done via VPN. It shows status as icon in tray.
The check is hardcoded for every 30 seconds.
There is no form or icon in taskbar.

## The reason behind it

I am very often jumping between servers in different countries also my router is configured to use VPN by default. I was tired to checking if I am on VPN or not so
created this. I used ChatGPT & GitHub Copilot to help also to check how they works.

Quite impressive is the answer :)

.... nope I am not doing anything illegal -> not the reason to have VPN in this case
